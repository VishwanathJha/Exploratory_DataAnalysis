##Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1

####R Code and output graphs for Course Project 1

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis".
Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 
4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to to the following:

1. Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
2. Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
3. Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
4. Run the scripts

P.S. I removed the names of the X axis in plot 4 and fixed the names of the Y axis to make the graphs look more consistent, so my plots slightly differ from the ones in the description
